# 🎯 Student Score Predictor

A beginner-friendly machine learning project to predict student exam scores based on the number of hours studied using **Linear Regression**.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Can we accurately predict a student’s exam score just by knowing how many hours they studied?  
This project demonstrates a simple **Supervised Learning** use case using **Linear Regression**.

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn

---

## 📁 Dataset

This project uses a small, open dataset with two columns:
- `Hours` – Number of hours studied  
- `Scores` – Percentage score obtained

---

## 🚀 Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**
2. **Data Visualization**
3. **Train/Test Split**
4. **Model Training (Linear Regression)**
5. **Prediction & Evaluation (R² Score, MAE)**
6. **Result Visualization**

---

## 📊 Results

- Achieved an **R² Score** of `0.95+`
- Model performs well on a small dataset
- Visualizations confirm a strong linear relationship between hours studied and scores
